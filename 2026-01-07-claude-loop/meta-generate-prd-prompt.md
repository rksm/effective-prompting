2026-01-07-claude-loop/create-loop-script.md contains a meta prompt for creating a script that controls the Claude code CLI. I want you to focus on the PRD.json(c) and PROMPT.md template mentioned in that document.

Create a new meta prompt that takes the PRD.json(c) and PROMPT.md templates and a narrative about some plan. Instruct the AI agent to carefully reason through the plan, point out conceptual issues, missing details and ask follow up questions to resolve those.

When all issues are resolved, the AI agent should produce a complete PRD.json(c) and PROMPT.md specific for the plan.

Please create a prompt for that purpose. Write it to 2026-01-07-claude-loop/generate-prd-prompt.md.
