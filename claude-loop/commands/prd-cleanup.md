We've previously worked on features that were captured in PRD.jsonc, PROMPT.md, and PROGRESS.md.

Please merge the content of these files into a single comprehensive document $1. Do not interpret, process, or change the content in any way; simply combine them as they are. Ensure that the merged document maintains the original formatting and structure of each file.

When done, remove the content of PRD.jsonc, PROMPT.md, and PROGRESS.md, leaving them empty. Commit these changes as well as the new document with a descriptive commit message.
