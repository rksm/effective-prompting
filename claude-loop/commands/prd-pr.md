Please look at all the changes of this branch. I want you to create a pull request on GitHub upstream for it. The pull request should start out with a rationale behind this PR. And it should then attach

- PRD.jsonc
- PROGRESS.md

verbatim to the PR description.

Before pushing the PR delete
- PRD.jsonc
- PROGRESS.md
- PROMPT.md
(they are just WIP files) and commit the deletion as a new commit as part of the PR.

If you have any questions for example about the context or rationale behind the PR please ask me before creating the PR but try to infer as much as you can from the provided plan files and committed changes.
